- **Status**: Complete
- **Notes**: Happy October! Hope everyone is having a good National Hispanic American Heritage Month! For those not in the United States, I hope your culture is celebrated and reflected on! We all need a place where we feel like we belong, I hope you are able to find that place!
  - Finished up the exercise, really simple considering that the exercise seems to focus on getting the coder to understand that Python has some **very powerful** out-of-the-box functions. All tests passed.
