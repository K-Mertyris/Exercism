- **Status**: In Progress
- **Notes**: Updating `.md` files to conform to standards (need to find those standards so I can add linting to my IDE). Created pseudocode in [`strings.md`](strings.md). Added initial docstring to [`strings.py`](strings.py), trying to figure out a standard for myself there too.
- **Misc**: It **seems** like doing it this way (creating setup files -> writing pseudocode -> coding) will take me longer overall, but I feel a lot better about what I will be coding because I have a better understanding of my goal. It may not be necessary later, especially with simpler functions w/in an app, but I'm going to stick with it for a bit to see how it feels overall and also see if it makes it easier for others to follow my thought process. It may also assist with refactoring when I come back and cycle through after I've been at this for a couple months.

### 2021-09-22

- **Status**: In progress
- **Notes**: Adding basic files - `README.md`, [`strings.md`](strings.md), [`strings.py`](strings.py). Setting up environment for coding:
  - `strings.py`: Copying code from Exercism exercise to IDE
  - `strings.md`: Creating structure for pseudocode
