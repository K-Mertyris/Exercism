# Purpose

This repo is meant to capture the work being done by going through the exercises on [Exercism](https://exercism.org/). There is some absolutely fantastic content on that site, so please support them or show them some love by visiting and promoting their work (if you believe in their mission).

## Stuff

I'm not *exactly* sure what I'm going to do with this `README`, so please bear with me as I learn things and as I iterate and organize my thoughts while learning. This is a journey where I'm paying as much attention to the path and sights as I am to the goal.

I'll be starting with Exercism's [Python Track](https://exercism.org/tracks/python). Who knows, if I keep up this habit, maybe I'll complete the Python track (*gasp*) and move on to [Bash](https://exercism.org/tracks/bash), [Vim](https://exercism.org/tracks/vimscript), or [Rust](https://exercism.org/tracks/rust), maybe even refresh my [C](https://exercism.org/tracks/c), [C++](https://exercism.org/tracks/cpp), or [Java](https://exercism.org/tracks/java) skills.
