- **Status**: Completed
- **Notes**: Getting weird feedback from the Exercism linter. It's saying that there's an unneccessary `elif` after `return`. I don't see how else I could run the conditionals unless I saved the resulting values from the tests into a variable and then passing that variable to the return statement at the end of the function instead of passing `return` as soon as the test meets a `True` condition. Gonna leave it for now, may come back after I understand the linting rules for Python a little better. Right now, it's good enough.

### 2021-10-04

- **Status**: In Progress
- **Notes**: Took a break over the past couple days because a project at work took precedence. Setting up the folders and creating the basic files. Adding this exercise to the main [`README.md`](../README.md) in the root folder. Created pseudocode and files. Will come back tomorrow and code.
  - [`meltdown.md`](meltdown.md): Space to create pseudocode and capture other notes about the project
  - [`meltdown.py`](meltdown.py): Copied code from Exercism exercise
