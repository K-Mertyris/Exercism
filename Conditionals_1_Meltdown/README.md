- **Status**: In Progress
- **Notes**: Took a break over the past couple days because a project at work took precedence. Setting up the folders and creating the basic files. Adding this exercise to the main [`README.md`](../README.md) in the root folder. Created pseudocode and files. Will come back tomorrow and code.
  - [`meltdown.md`](meltdown.md): Space to create pseudocode and capture other notes about the project
  - [`meltdown.py`](meltdown.py): Copied code from Exercism exercise
