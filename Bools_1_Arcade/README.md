- **Status**: Complete
- **Notes**: Wrote the code for this exercise tonight, went pretty quickly. Things I learned:
  - The Exercism Python linter prefers the `is` keyword when evaluating experessions versus the `==` operator. I could have also evaluated the variables directly in the `if` statements, but I've found that reading through code that's built that way takes me out of just *reading* the code and now I have to interpret it as well, so I have a tendency to avoid that convention when programming. I have the same avoidance for using `NOT`.

### 2021-09-26

- **Status**: In Progress
- **Notes**: Building the folder for the exercise, created files, pseudocode written.
  - Files created:
    - `README.md`: This file.
    - [`arcade_game.md`](arcade_game.md): File that contains the pseudocode and other info about the app.
    - [`arcade_game.py`](arcade_game.py): File that contains the code for the app.
