## Current Status

2021-09-20:

- Status: In progress
- Notes: After running the checks, the final two requirements are failing. Will need to circle back, pseudocode them and try again.

- Status: In progress
- Notes:
  - First PR tonight - added pseudocode for the `exchangable_value` function.
    - Result: Pseudocode is correct, coding followed pseudocode, tests passed. Keeping pseudocode in until all tests pass, then removing all pseudocode for final commit.
