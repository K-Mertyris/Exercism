- **Status**: Complete
- **Notes**: Set up last night to work the code. Looks pretty straightforward, only two functions. Couldn't find the formula I was looking for, so I'll likely brute force solving the equation for the sum of all grains on the chessboard.
- **Results**: All tests passed, simple code. Created a `TODO` to come back and time the functions once I learn a bit more.

### 2021-09-27

- **Status**: In Progress
- **Notes**: Setting up the folders and creating the basic files. Adding this exercise to the main [`README.md`](../README.md) in the root folder.
  - [`grains.md`](grains.md): Space to create pseudocode and capture other notes about the project
  - [`grains.py`](grains.py): Copied code from Exercism exercise
